In this first development diary I'd like to share where we're at. Right now PostTrio is in the planning & prototyping stage. We have big ideas, but little to show, and are looking to change that.

With that in mind, we do have something to show! For any app, the user-interface or *UI* is a big deal. For us it's an even bigger deal. Our goal is to build an interface that is completely intuitive to understand. We can't make **digital marketing** easy if our app isn't easy-to-use.

This week we are prototyping the *first-time* experience of a user. That is, once they have an account, what do they see? We've decided on a **survey** we want to cater the recommendations & tools we provide to our user's goals and desires. Check out the whole process below!
